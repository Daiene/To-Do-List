Write down your tasks for the day, mark them as done, edit or delete them.

## Description
The objective of this project was to work a little more with JavaScript and learn more and more about this programming language.
I created a to-do list where you can add your activities for the day, mark them as done, edit them and even delete them.
It is also possible to track the day and time, available in the project template.
